x.y.z
==============================================================================
    * rebase and peflags now support operations on 64bit objects
    * New database functionality (see README)
    * New developer application rebase-dump for displaying database contents
    * New platform support: x86_64-w64-mingw32, i686-pc-msys
    * Many algorithm improvements

3.0.2
==============================================================================
    * Autoconfify. Silence build warnings. Add support for building (natively,
      for each platform) on mingw, msys, and cygwin. Support dash/ash usage.
      Add workaround for broken getopt_long on MSYS.

3.0.1
==============================================================================
    * Placeholder.

3.0:
==============================================================================
    * New peflags utility allows to manipulate the following
      flags in DLLs:
           peflags [OPTIONS] [-T filelist | -] file(s)...
      
          -d, --dynamicbase [BOOL]  Image base address may be
                                    relocated using address space
                                    layout randomization (ASLR)
          -t, --tsaware     [BOOL]  Image is Terminal Server aware

      as well as a number of other flags (see --help output).

      By default, cygwin DLLs have 0 for both flags. Setting -d1
      for all DLLs (except cygwin1.dll) may be useful on Windows
      Vista and above. Setting -t1 on all executables may be useful
      on Windows Terminal Server.

      Use '-v' (or any of the flag arguments with no BOOL) to
      see the current flag settings for a given DLL or list of
      DLLs.

    * New peflagsall utility. You remember your SATs, right:
      peflagsall:peflags::rebaseall:rebase

The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Exclude cyglsa64.dll from rebase list

2.4.4:
==============================================================================
    * Change rebaseall to prevent "Argument list too long" errors as
      reported in:

      http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2005-09/msg00836.html

    * Change rebase to use modern method to find the image's
      IMAGE_NT_SIGNATURE as suggested in:
    
      http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2006-02/msg00645.html

    * Change imagehelper library so it compiles under gcc 3.4.x
      (and hopefully later) as suggested in an email from Jens Dill.

    * Change rebaseall to use a tighter regular expression when
      creating the rebase list.

2.4.3:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Changes to support Cygwin's CYGWIN=transparent_exe option.

2.4.2:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Change zcat to "gzip -d -c" and egrep to "grep -E" to avoid the possibly
      of invoking a (bash) shell script.

2.4.1:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Change the "only ash processes are running" check to support 9X/Me.
    * Add setting PATH to support environments that do not have Cygwin's bin
      in the Windows' system PATH.

2.4:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Change to exit with rebase's exit code instead of unconditionally
      exiting with zero (Axel Naumann).
    * Convert from bash to ash script.
    * Remove obsolete Apache hack.
    * Add support for spaces in file and directory paths.
    * Add rebasing of .so files too.
    * Add suffix option (i.e., -s) to support rebasing of DLLs with
      non-standard extensions.
    * Add support to verify that only ash processes are running or exit.
