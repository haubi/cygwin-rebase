This is a mostly complete rewrite of the win api function RebaseImage() 
for changing the base address of win32 dll's. 
The rebasing is done by changing the ImageBase field in the image header 
and relocating all available relocations found in the .reloc section of 
the image. 

The main reasons for this rewrite are, that 
1. WinMe does not support the RebaseImage() 
2. the recent binutils strip command corrupts dll's linked with debugging informations. 

Please send questions and notes relating to this application to the kde-cygwin mailing list.
